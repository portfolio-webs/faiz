                    Lamborghini was founded in 1963 by Ferruccio Lamborghini. Initially, Ferruccio was a tractor manufacturer, but his passion for cars led him to start 
                    his own automobile company. He believed he could build a luxury sports car that was better than Ferrari, focusing on both style and performance.

                    Ferruccio Lamborghini, born in Italy, was not only a successful industrialist but also an innovator. After a heated discussion with Enzo Ferrari 
                    about the quality of Ferrari cars, Ferruccio decided to create his own automobile brand. This determination gave birth to the iconic Lamborghini.
                </p>
                <blockquote>"Ferruccio believed luxury and power could be combined to create something extraordinary."</blockquote>
